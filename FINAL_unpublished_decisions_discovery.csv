54,Queens,"""The People filed their COC without disclosing numerous [evidence]; the COC and statement of readiness filed without those materials, and with no showing of good faith or due diligence, were invalid."""
55,Queens,"""Here, the proffered reasons for the People's delayed disclosure are not satisfactory to this Court.

56,Queens,"""Accordingly, without evidence of due diligence or a showing of special circumstances, the People’s COCs and supplemental COCs filed without the [evidence] is invalid."""
57,Queens,"""In this case, the Court cannot conclude that the People exercised due diligence to ascertain the existence of material and information subject to discovery before the filing of the initial certificate of compliance.

58,Queens,"""The People make no showing of due diligence or good faith in attempts to make those records discoverable."""
59,Kings,"""While the court acknowledges the efforts the People did make to locate the [evidence], it is undisputable that they did not begin searching for it until after they had already filed their initial COC and SOR."""
59,Kings,"""Therefore, for the People to hypothesize that such [evidence] probably doesn’t exist due to police non-responsiveness is insufficient for this court to make a finding of due diligence."""
60,Kings,"""Here, the court finds the People have failed to establish the prerequisite: that their efforts to obtain the missing materials were diligent and reasonable under the circumstances."""
61,Kings,"""The People’s explanation for the lack of discovery is inadequate and does not comport with due diligence nor with reasonable inquiry. Thus, a COC could not have been deemed proper under this scenario."""
62,Queens,"""However, the discovery was not completed because the People failed to provide the [evidence]."""
63,Kings,"""Under these circumstances, the court finds that the People have not timely and diligently complied with their obligations."""

67,Kings,"""Accordingly, the People’s failure to act in good faith and due diligence to ascertain the existence and serve [evidence] renders their CoC invalid."""
68,Kings,"""In sum, the People's COC was invalid for their failure to turn over numerous essential items of discovery."""
69,Queens,"""Since the People failed to disclose the [evidence] as a part of automatic discovery, the certificate of compliance is illusory."""
70,NY,"""Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the People did not demonstrate good faith, act reasonably or exercise due diligence in their efforts to disclose all impeachment materials to the defendant."""
71,NY,"""Rather than provide a descriptive or meaningful discovery list, the People here provided a list of electronic file names (many, a series of letters and numbers). The People's chosen format undermines the statutory intent and spirit of article 245 to promote openness, fairness, and timeliness of discovery disclosures, and makes the process of assessing the completeness of the People's disclosures more difficult for defendant and the court."""
71,NY,"""As the [evidence] contain statements made by law enforcement [that are discoverable] and the People did not exercise diligence to obtain and disclose them, their original COC was not valid."""
72,Queens,"""Providing summary letters of disciplinary records and a late disclosure with piecemeal underlying records, without any explanation, is not proof of 'due diligence'."""
72,Queens,"""This is not a case where the People were awaiting discovery, reviewing recently received discovery or mistakenly withheld information in good faith; nor is this a situation of inadvertent failure to disclose discovery.

76,Kings,"""The People’s explanations that they were unaware that materials in NYPD possession existed, and the NYPD did not turn over the [evidence] prior to the filing of the COC are not sufficient to excuse untimely disclosure."""
77,Kings,"""Because the People have not provided an adequate explanation for this error that would allow the court to conclude that it was not due to a lack of diligence, the court must deem the People’s certificate of compliance invalid."""
78,Queens,"""Weighing all the above factors, and taking into account the relevant facts as set forth in the parties’ filings and the court file, the court finds that notwithstanding their good faith, the People failed to exercise due diligence and make reasonable inquiries to ascertain the existence of the [evidence]."""
79,Bronx,"""Moreover, the People failed to describe any due diligence in attempting to obtain the [evidence] prior to filing their COC."""

81,Queens,"""Indeed, while the People may have acted in good faith, the record indicates an explicit lack of due diligence and failure to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain the [evidence], which they concede is discoverable."""
82,Richmond,"""Even more troubling is that after defense counsel specifically asked the People for these records, the People outright refused to try and obtain them. Obstinance is not due diligence and is certainly not keeping with the legislative intent or spirit of discovery compliance. Accordingly, the Court finds the People’s COC filed on [date redacted], to be invalid, in light of the People’s lack of due diligence and nonexistent efforts to obtain the [evidence] which they had a duty to disclose."""
83,Queens,"""In this case, the prosecution did not diligently seek to ascertain and disclose known discoverable items that were in their possession prior to the filing of their initial COC."""
84,Queens,"""The People have not outlined any diligent efforts to obtain the [evidence] requested by the defendant and merely state they have already disclosed more materials than statutorily required. The Court disagrees."""
85,NY,"""This issue can be simply resolved with a phone call to the complainant, yet the People have made no efforts to ascertain the information. Throughout the entirety of their response, the People have repeatedly thrown their hands up and refused to make any efforts to discover any information about this case."""
86,Kings,"""However, the People did not act with the requisite level of diligence with respect to the [evidence]."""
87,NY,"""These actions do not constitute good faith, nor are they evidence that the People’s decision not to disclose these documents prior to filing their [date redacted] COC was based on case law."""
87,NY,"""For these reasons, the People’s actions with respect to the [evidence] do not constitute due diligence and their COC was invalid for this reason as well."""
88,Queens,"""In the instant case, the People have not shown that they had exercised due diligence in attempting to obtain discoverable [evidence] not in their possession."""
89,Kings,"""The Prosecution argues that they are not in possession of underlying attachments embedded in IAB logs, and that such attachments are not subject to disclosure. However, the materials are in police possession and therefore statutorily in the prosecution's possession."""
90,Queens,"""The People have not met their burden to show due diligence for undisclosed [evidence]."""
91,Queens,"""The People clearly misunderstand their discovery and Brady obligations. [...] There is no reasonable justification for the People’s belated disclosure of the surveillance videos."""

99,Kings,"""This court finds that the People did not exercise the requisite due diligence regarding the [evidence] in this matter. First, the People do not cite to any attempts to ascertain the existence of the [evidence] prior to the statutory deadline imposed by [the discovery law] to perform their discovery obligations.

108,Kings,"""As such, the People’s [date redacted], Certificate of Compliance is invalid for failing to disclose [misconduct records] for potentially testifying officers."""
109,Queens,"""The type of COC that the People are hereby advancing – one in which the People certify that they anticipate serving, but have not actually served, discovery on defense counsel – is not one contemplated by the statute."""
110,Queens,"""It is unclear why the People waited seven months after filing their original COC to first speak to an officer regarding how the police were brought to the scene.

117,Queens,"""Adding extraneous discovery to the disclosure while neglecting one of the most vital pieces of discovery undercuts a finding of due diligence. A reasonable ADA acting in good faith and with due diligence might make some oversights during the discovery process but he or she would also be expected to turn over the most-important evidentiary items and not share dozens of unrelated items."""
118,Kings,"""Because the [evidence] and [police disciplinary records] were with the NYPD, the court cannot find that the People acted with the necessary good faith and due diligence to timely obtain the belatedly disclosed materials."""

252,Bronx,"""Remarkably, it has now come to light that even as the People were representing in court on [date redacted] that they had no such [police reports] and believed them not to exist, the People were in actual possession of 819 pages of [police reports] associated with this case two days prior to the discovery conference, i.e. on [date redacted]."""
252,Bronx,"""Upon realizing that they had provided incorrect information to the Court bearing directly on the Court’s COC ruling, the People should have alerted the Court themselves and corrected the record, rather than leaving it to Defendant to do so."""
253,NY,"""Thus, the failure to disclose the [evidence] prior to filing the original COC renders it invalid."""
254,Bronx,"""In the circumstances presented, the court finds that the People’s conduct falls short of due diligence and reasonableness."""
254,Bronx,"""Therefore, the People’s lack of explanation for their failure to even ascertain this basic item directly relating to the allegations is wholly deficient and not reasonable under these circumstances."""
255,Queens,"""As this Court stated in its prior decision on this case, where the People possess discoverable material after the initial certificate of compliance and fail to disclose said material, they violate their discovery obligations under [the law]."""
256,Queens,"""The People have not described any effort to obtain the [evidence] before filing their COC. Without a showing of due diligence and reasonable inquiry, the COC filed without ‘that information is invalid."""
257,Queens,"""Neither the COC or the People’s response to the motion to dismiss provides a basis for why there was a belief that the People would not be able to obtain the [evidence] in a reasonable amount of time."""
258,Kings,"""The People have failed to set forth facts showing their due diligence by failing to disclose the [evidence] with their initial disclosure or set forth special circumstances."""
259,Kings,"""The People made minimal effort to comply with their discovery obligations until time was running out on them and they have provided no excuse for this delay."""
260,NY,"""Further, given references to the civilian witness in the [evidence] and prosecution case notes, the People’s response fails to provide the court with a factual basis to support a finding of due diligence."""
261,Queens,"""When the People chose not to disclose [police disciplinary records] that were in their possession, they were not providing '[a]ll evidence and information' in their possession as mandated by [the discovery law]."""
262,Kings,"""It is evident, therefore, that the People were in actual possession of the records and simply failed to disclose them."""
263,Kings,"""Where the People’s own discovery indicates the existence of other discovery that they fail to obtain and turn over, particularly where it is a standard item of discovery, such is not due diligence [...] Here, the People were in possession of [evidence] and, if they had sufficiently familiarized themselves with the case, they should have known there was [another evidence item] and disclosed it to the defendant. [Having not done so], the People have failed to demonstrate diligence and reasonableness under the circumstances."""
264,Kings,"""Therefore, the facts fail to establish that the People engaged in diligent, good faith efforts to obtain the materials."""
265,NY,"""Accordingly, upon consideration of the circumstances in this case, this court finds that the People did not exercise due diligence and act reasonably in their efforts to comply with [the discovery law]."""
265,NY,"""As these materials have not yet been turned over, all of the People's COCs are improper."""
266,Richmond,"""I[T]he failure to turn over those underlying records invalidates the People’s COC dated [date redacted], and supplemental COC dated [date redacted], as the requested documents are still outstanding."""
267,Kings,"""In light of the People’s failure to demonstrate that the belatedly disclosed materials did not exist when they filed the original COC, as alleged in their SCOC, the court cannot find that the People acted with the necessary good faith and due diligence to timely obtain them. The People’s COC is, thus, invalid."""
267,Kings,"""While this court acknowledges that the People did make some amount of effort to obtain the [evidence], it does not find that the efforts were diligent."""
268,Kings,"""In light of the foregoing, this court finds that the People did not act with the requisite due diligence to ascertain the existence of and produce the [evidence] before the filing of the original COC. Accordingly, the People’s COC is invalid."""
269,Queens,"""However, the People chose not to disclose [police disciplinary records]. Accordingly, the certificate of compliance is invalid."""
270,Kings,"""Here, the People did not provide the [police] disciplinary records prior to filing their initial certificate of compliance. As a result, their [date redacted], certificate of compliance is deemed invalid."""
271,NY,"""At issue is whether the People exercised due diligence with respect to the [evidence]. They did not."""
272,Queens,"""The People never disclosed the above discussed [evidence] to Defendant."""
273,Queens,"""Given the serious deficiencies in both the People’s certificate of compliance and the People’s explanation thereof, the court finds that it was not reasonable under the circumstances. Further, the court does not have sufficient information to determine whether it was filed in good faith."""
274,NY,"""People’s delay here evinces a lack of due diligence. They waited twenty-eight (28) days after filing their CoC to inquire about materials that they should have known existed."""
274,NY,"""The Court is not convinced that People made such efforts here, particularly since they waited two (2) months after receiving a [required document] before subpoenaing the records, another delay for which they provide no explanation."""
275,Bronx,"""Based upon the foregoing, this Court finds that the People failed to articulate a basis for their belated disclosures in their SCOCs rendering their [date redacted] COC invalid."""
276,NY,"""Upon consideration of the circumstances in this case, the court finds that the People did not exercise due diligence or act reasonably in their efforts to comply with their discovery obligations."""
277,Queens,"""The People’s showing of due diligence is unpersuasive. Relying on blanket assurances that all discoverable material was already disclosed without reviewing the evidence itself is not diligent."""
278,Kings,"""The People have not provided an adequate explanation for their failure to provide the [evidence] prior to filing the certificate of compliance. The People’s only explanation for the delayed disclosure in the supplemental certificate of compliance was to say that they were unaware of their existence despite their due diligence."""
279,NY,"""Thus, the People have failed to show they exercised due diligence with respect to the [evidence], and the COC is invalidated for this reason."""
280,NY,"""[T]he Court finds that due diligence was not properly set forth, and as such, the COC, dated [date redacted] is deemed to be invalid."""
281,NY,"""Here, the People submitted long boilerplate argument about why they believe the [police disciplinary] records are not discoverable. They have not, however, described any efforts to obtain and disclose those records prior to the filing of their COC [...] The People's failure to timely and fully seek and disclose these items does not satisfy the due diligence standards."""
282,Queens,"""Where the People do not seek any of the numerous opportunities available for relief, they cannot be said to have exercised due diligence before filing their COC."""
283,Richmond,"""Without further information from the [name redacted] detailing their efforts to ascertain the existence of all relevant material, the Court finds that the [name redacted] have failed to establish due diligence."""
283,Richmond,"""As such, the Court finds that the COC filed on [date redacted], is invalid. The court finds that the supplemental COCs filed on [date redacted], and [date redacted], are also invalid as they did not cure the due diligence issues that invalidated the initial COC."""
284,NY,"""Nor is the court persuaded by the People’s argument that their COC was filed in good faith due to the absence of controlling appellate authority. To the contrary, such authority did exist; given the First Department decision in [case name]. Furthermore, any differences of opinion at the trial level should have prompted the People to take the safer approach of disclosing the materials given that the [discovery law] mandates 'a presumption in favor of disclosure [of evidence]' when interpreting its provisions."""
285,Kings,"""Without rehashing the bulk of the [defendant's] argument, it is uncontroverted that for many of the missing items of discovery, the People knew or should have been aware of their existence [but did not turn them over]."""
285,Kings,"""Additionally, the Court cannot accept the People’s position that they failed to disclose the copious amounts of NYPD materials because they were not in their possession at the time they filed their COC."""
286,Bronx,"""This case is the hallmark of a lack of diligence."""
286,Bronx,"""The People’s behavior in this case from its inception represents a disservice not only to the judicial process but to the parties injured because of the accident."""
287,Kings,"""The People’s papers fail to demonstrate any diligent efforts to obtain the [evidence] prior to filing their COC or show that they had a good faith basis to believe the [evidence] was not discoverable."""
288,Queens,"""It is good to see that the Queens District Attorney’s Office has changed its policy as to complying with their discovery obligations. In this case, it is too late since the compliance came 116 days after the commencement of the criminal action."""
289,Kings,"""As such, the court cannot find that the People exercised good faith and diligent efforts to obtain and disclose this information in a timely manner, rendering the COC invalid."""
290,Queens,"""As it appears that the [evidence] itself was never actually sent to defense counsel but merely emails indicating it was attached without the actual attachment discovery was incomplete at the time of certification."""
291,Queens,"""Accordingly, the court finds that the People's COC is invalid due to failure to disclose all underlying police disciplinary records."""
292,Queens,"""Without any information establishing that these [evidence items] do not exist, or that the People made a diligent, good faith effort to produce them, the missing [evidence] are a proper ground to invalidate the People’s COC."""
293,Queens,"""The People make no showing of diligent inquires to obtain and disclose all body worn camera footage prior to filing their COC. Rather, the People stated in their supplemental COC that their diligent efforts took place after they filed their COC."""
294,Queens,"""In short, the People's COC was invalid because they failed to turn over the underlying [police disciplinary] material for [name redacted] until three months after their original COC was filed."""
294,Queens,"""While the People provided supplemental discovery, the People did not demonstrate, or even try to show, that they had previously exercised due diligence to obtain the supplemental material, or that such material did not exist or was not previously in the People's possession or control."""
295,Kings,"""It is insufficient for the People to omit the specific steps they took to obtain outstanding [evidence] and instead, state in a conclusory manner, that they acted in good faith."""
296,Kings,"""The People do not contest that these documents were omitted from discovery and do not provide any details as to why they have not been provided."""
296,Kings,"""Based on the motion papers and the court record, the People have failed to provide the court with adequate details of their diligent, good faith efforts in complying with their automatic discovery obligations."""
297,NY,"""The People's assertion that they acted diligently, and that minor human error is to blame defies the record. Like the previous omissions, the People offer no reasonable explanation for this final discovery failure. They provide no iteration of their efforts to ensure this new information was disclosed timely. The People's indication that the error should be excused because they did not act 'with malicious intent' relates a gross misunderstanding of what it means to make a good faith representation of discovery compliance."""
297,NY,"""Good faith does not abound where the People fail to exercise due diligence and make reasonable inquiries."""
298,Kings,"""The People failed to exercise the requisite due diligence when they withheld clearly discoverable material. As such, the People’s COC was invalid."""
